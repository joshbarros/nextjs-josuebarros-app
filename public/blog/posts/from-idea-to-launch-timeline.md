# From Idea to Launch: A Realistic Timeline for Your MVP

The internet is full of "I built a SaaS in 48 hours" posts. Here's what they don't tell you: most of those products have zero users.

## The Honest Timeline

### Week 1: Discovery & Architecture
- Understanding your actual problem (not what you think it is)
- Designing data models
- Setting up infrastructure
- **Output:** Technical spec, deployed empty shell

### Week 2-3: Core Features
- Authentication & user management
- The ONE feature that defines your product
- Basic admin functionality
- **Output:** Working prototype, invite-only

### Week 4-5: Integration & Polish
- Third-party integrations (payments, email, etc.)
- Error handling
- Loading states (people forget these!)
- **Output:** Beta-ready product

### Week 6-8: Testing & Iteration
- Real user feedback
- Bug fixes
- Performance optimization
- **Output:** Launch-ready product

### Week 9-10: Launch Prep
- Documentation
- Monitoring setup
- Marketing pages
- **Output:** Public launch

## Why This Takes 10 Weeks (Not 2)

The "weekend MVP" crowd is building toys. You're building a business.

### Hidden Time Sinks
- **OAuth integration:** 2-3 days (every time)
- **Email deliverability:** Ongoing battle
- **Payment edge cases:** Refunds, failed charges, subscriptions
- **Mobile responsiveness:** Add 30% to all estimates

## How to Actually Go Faster

1. **Start with design.** Figma before code saves weeks.
2. **Use proven patterns.** Don't reinvent authentication.
3. **Ship incrementally.** Get feedback on day 1, not day 60.
4. **Hire someone who's done it.** (That's where I come in.)

The goal isn't to ship fast—it's to ship *right* the first time.
