# Scaling Your MVP: When to Add a Team

You've got product-market fit. Users are loving your MVP. Now what? The hardest part of building a startup isn't the initial product—it's knowing when and how to scale your team.

## The Solo Founder Ceiling

Most founders can build an MVP alone, but scaling requires a different skill set. Here's when you know it's time to bring in help:

### Product-Market Fit Signals
- **Retention**: 40%+ monthly active users returning
- **Growth**: 20%+ month-over-month user growth
- **Revenue**: Recurring revenue covering your burn rate
- **Feedback**: Users actively requesting features

### Technical Debt Indicators
- **Performance Issues**: Load times >3 seconds
- **Bug Reports**: More than you can fix in a day
- **Feature Requests**: Backlog growing faster than you can build
- **Code Quality**: You're afraid to touch certain files

## Roles to Hire First

### The First Hire: Developer
**Why First?** Code scales horizontally, people don't.

**What to Look For:**
- Experience with your tech stack
- Can work independently
- Shares your product vision
- **Red Flag:** Wants to rewrite everything

### The Second Hire: Designer
**Why Next?** User experience drives retention.

**What to Look For:**
- Product design experience (not just graphics)
- Can create user flows and wireframes
- Understands technical constraints
- **Red Flag:** Treats design as "making things pretty"

## Building a Team Culture

### Values Over Experience
Hire for cultural fit first, skills second. You can teach someone to code, but you can't teach them to care about your mission.

### Equity and Compensation
- **Equity**: 0.5-1% for early employees (vesting over 4 years)
- **Salary**: Competitive with big tech (you're competing for talent)
- **Benefits**: Health insurance, remote work, flexible hours

## The Hiring Process

### Step 1: Define the Role
Write a job description that attracts the right people:
- What they'll work on
- Growth opportunities
- Company mission
- Required skills vs. nice-to-haves

### Step 2: Source Candidates
- **LinkedIn**: Post jobs, reach out directly
- **AngelList**: Great for early-stage startups
- **GitHub**: Find developers by their contributions
- **Your Network**: Best source for cultural fit

### Step 3: Technical Interview
Focus on problem-solving, not trivia:
- Give them a real problem from your codebase
- Ask about trade-offs they've made
- Discuss how they handle ambiguity

### Step 4: Culture Interview
- Share your company vision
- Discuss how they handle failure
- Ask about their biggest professional accomplishment

## Common Hiring Mistakes

### Hiring Too Early
**Problem:** You don't have product-market fit yet.
**Solution:** Focus on validation first, growth second.

### Hiring Too Late
**Problem:** You're overwhelmed and burning out.
**Solution:** Hire when you're 2-3 months behind schedule.

### Hiring for Now vs. Future
**Problem:** Hiring junior developers who can't scale with you.
**Solution:** Hire people who can grow into leadership roles.

## Scaling Your Process

### From Solo to Team
- **Daily Standups**: 15-minute sync every morning
- **Code Reviews**: Mandatory for all changes
- **Documentation**: Wiki for processes and decisions
- **One-on-Ones**: Weekly with each team member

### Tools for Scaling
- **GitHub**: Code hosting and project management
- **Linear/Notion**: Issue tracking and documentation
- **Slack**: Communication (keep it async when possible)
- **Google Workspace**: Email, docs, and collaboration

## The Biggest Challenge: Delegation

Learning to let go is harder than learning to code. Trust your team, give them ownership, and focus on the big picture.

**Remember:** Your job as founder evolves from "do everything" to "enable everyone else to do their best work."

The transition from solo founder to team leader is the hardest pivot you'll make—but it's also when your startup truly begins.
