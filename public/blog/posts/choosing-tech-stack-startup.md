# How to Choose Your Startup's Tech Stack in 2024

Every week, a founder asks me: "What's the best tech stack for my startup?"

My answer is always the same: **It depends on who's going to work on it.**

## The Hiring Reality

The "best" technology means nothing if you can't hire for it. Here's what I recommend based on your situation:

### If You're Hiring Junior Developers
- **Frontend:** React (massive talent pool)
- **Backend:** Node.js or Python
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Hosting:** Vercel or Railway

### If You're Hiring Senior Engineers
- **Frontend:** Whatever they prefer
- **Backend:** Go, Rust, or Elixir (they'll make it work)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (some things never change)
- **Hosting:** Kubernetes on GCP/AWS

### If It's Just You (For Now)
- **Frontend:** Next.js (full-stack in one)
- **Backend:** Supabase for everything
- **Database:** Included with Supabase
- **Hosting:** Vercel

## Technologies I Always Recommend

1. **TypeScript** — The time savings from catching bugs early is worth the learning curve
2. **PostgreSQL** — Battle-tested, scales further than you think
3. **Docker** — Eliminates "works on my machine" forever

## Technologies I Avoid for MVPs

1. **Microservices** — You don't need them until you really, really do
2. **GraphQL** — REST is fine for 95% of startups
3. **Kubernetes** — Managed services are cheaper than your time

## The Bottom Line

Pick boring technology. Save your innovation budget for your actual product.
